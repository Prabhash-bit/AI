After discussing direct prompt injection, we will discuss indirect prompt injection. 
Indirect prompt injection attacks occur when an attacker can place a payload in a resource, which is subsequently fed to an LLM. 
The critical difference to direct prompt injection is that the attacker does not directly interact with the LLM but through an indirection.

For example, consider an LLM that is tasked with summarizing incoming e-mails. 
If an attacker can send an e-mail containing a prompt injection payload to the LLM, prompt injection vulnerabilities may occur. 
However, since the attacker does not feed the payload directly to the LLM but rather indirectly via an e-mail, which is subsequently used in the LLM prompt, it is an indirect prompt injection attack.

In this section, we will explore three different indirect prompt injection scenarios.
